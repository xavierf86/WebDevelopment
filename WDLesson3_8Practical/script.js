/* Challenge 4: Does the function name match the event handler referenced in the event listener? */
function cylinder(){
  /*The function was wrong, it should be cylinder()*/
  /* Challenge 5: Are there any errors in retrieving and parsing the information from the text inputs? */
  let r = parseInt(document.getElementById("r").value);
  let h = parseInt(document.getElementById("h").value);


  /* Challenge 6: Does the variable output correctly create a reference to the output container? */
  let output = document.getElementById("output");
  /*this has .value, when it shouldnt*/

  /* Challenge 7: Is the following calculation for volume of a cylinder correct? */
  let v = Math.PI * Math.pow(r,2) * h;
  /*This should be multiplying by h, not divinding, and math was lowercased, should be Math*/

  /* Challenge 8: Are there any errors in displaying the output? */
  output.innerHTML = "Volume of the cylinder is " + v
  /* Fix the quotation marks, and taek the v out of the brackets, with it being outside the quotation marks.*/
